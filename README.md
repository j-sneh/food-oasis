Currently, 30% of all food ends up as food waste and 25% of areas are considered food deserts throughout the United States. To combat this problem, we decided to create Food Oasis. Food Oasis color codes all the US counties based on their VLFS (Very Low Food Security) level, and connects existing farms, biofuel facilities, and food pantries within county limits. The short distance between the farms and biofuel facilities and food pantries incentivizes farmers to give back their surplus to their communities. We plan to transport blemished and decomposing goods using third-party shipping companies by asking them to make a "pit stop" to transport the goods along their already established route.
